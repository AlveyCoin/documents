Alveychain is built on Polygon Edge, which lets the project bootstrap a new blockchain network while providing full compatibility with Ethereum smart contracts and transactions. It uses IBFT (Istanbul Byzantine Fault Tolerant) consensus mechanism, supported [PoS (proof of stake)](../docs/consensus/pos-stake-unstake/).

Industry standard wallets can be used to interact with Alveychain through the [JSON-RPC](../docs/working-with-node/query-json-rpc/) endpoints and node operators can perform various actions on the nodes through the [gRPC](../docs/working-with-node/query-operator-info/) protocol.
